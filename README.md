This work was greatly inspired by Sebastian Lague's tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN39W020LqU]

## Future work considerations

* Live height-based texture editing
* More advanced lightning using shadow volumes [http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/volume_shadows_tutorial_nuclear.pdf]
